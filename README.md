# <center>Super Simple Image Optimizer

**A python application to optimize images.**
Uses Python 3.x

## Modules:
  • Pillow
  
  • pathlib
  
  • tkinter


## Features :
1) Image gets optimized as soon as it is browsed.

2) Current quality set to 50% because no noticable loss was observed in the quality till this point

## How to use:
1) The program was made to test out the features of tkinter, so to run it, just run the python file.

2) Type the following in cmd/terminal/PowerShell `python [path of 'super simple imaage opti.py']`
Note - As the filename contains spaces, put the path in double inverted commas.

## TODO :
1) Add slider to set quality [ ]
2) Add a button to optimize instead of direct optimization on browsing [ ]
3) Beautify the interface [ ]
4) Add resizing and other functionalities [ ]
