**A python application to optimize images.**
Uses Python 3.x

**Modules** :

  • Pillow
  
  • pathlib
  
  • tkinter



**Features** :
1) Image gets optimized as soon as it is browsed.
2) Current quality set to 50% because no noticable loss was observed in the quality till this point




Current **TODO** list :
1) Add slider to set quality [ ]

2) Add a button to optimize instead of direct optimization on browsing [ ]

3) Beautify the interface [ ]

4) Add resizing and other functionalities [ ]
